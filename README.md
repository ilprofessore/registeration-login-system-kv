# registeration-login-system-kv
an offline registration login system which can be integrated and used for any other python-kivy app.
tried an implimentation of the app that i made in tkinter to be made in kivy.
records are saved offline and are certainly not the best but get the job done.
can be compliles into an apk using buildozer, in ubuntu.
